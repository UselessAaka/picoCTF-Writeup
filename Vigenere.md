This is the cipher given to us and a key, we are gonna use the process of solving vignere cipher.
First method can be using the online decoder for a vignere cipher,

in the key we have put 'CYLAB' and encrypted our main code.

Secondly another thing we can do is solving manually, through the vignere cipher table i.e.

basically, if firstletter  in key is 'C' we will take first letter from the original cipher too i.e.'r'
